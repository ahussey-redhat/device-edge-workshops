# To-Dos

1. ~~Test hypervisor node code~~
2. Add Route53/DNS
3. Add packages to initial image creation for running app "bare-metal"
4. Setup 2nd image | podman-based
5. Setup 3rd image | microshift-based
6. Figure out how to move HEAD in rpm-ostree repo
7. Update documentation _significantly_
8. ~~Build hypervisor - mostly just cockpit setup~~
9. Populate Controller

## Nice-to-Haves

1. Valid SSL certs on Controller
2. Valid SSL certs on Cockpit
3. Probably can check for existing Controller input before running copy/extract tasks as well
4. Really the student_users role should be more modular and just be looped over/included
