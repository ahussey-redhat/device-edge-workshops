# To-Dos

1. ~~Test hypervisor node code~~
2. ~~Add Route53/DNS for management services~~
3. ~~Add packages to initial image creation for running app "bare-metal"~~
4. ~~Setup 2nd image | podman-based~~
5. ~~Setup 3rd image | microshift-based~~
6. Figure out how to move HEAD in rpm-ostree repo
7. Update documentation _significantly_
8. ~~Build hypervisor - mostly just cockpit setup~~
9. ~~Populate Controller~~
10. ~~Pull EEs immediately during install~~
11. ~~Add to provisioning workflow: set device hostname~~
12. Move this stupid list to isseus
13. Handle local DNS

## Nice-to-Haves

1. ~~Valid SSL certs on Controller~~
2. ~~Valid SSL certs on Cockpit~~
3. ~~Probably can check for existing Controller input before running copy/extract tasks as well~~
4. ~~Really the student_users role should be more modular and just be looped over/included~~
5. ~~Do we really need rhsm registration? (I doubt it?)~~
6. ~~Use DNS for rpm-ostree repo (would require DNS in local, easy in AWS)~~
7. Can gitea.ini be templated out so web links work?
