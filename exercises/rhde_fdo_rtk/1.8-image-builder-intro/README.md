## Objective

In this exercise, we are going to get logged to the Image Builder WebUI, ensuring our credentials work as expected.

This exercise will cover:

* Understanding how to access the Image Builder WebUI
* Ensuring our credentials work as expected


### Step 1 - Retreving The Image Builder WebUI Address and Credentials

Your student page will contain the URL for Image Builder's WebUI, and your credentials. Denote these for the next step.

For a reminder on how to access your student page, ask your instructor.

### Step 2 - Logging In to the Image Builder WebUI

Enter your credentials into the appropriate field on the login page:

![Image Builder Login](../images/cockit-login.png)

Once logged in, click on 'Image Builder' in the top left corner:

![Empty Image Builder](../images/empty-image-builder.png)

This window should be empty, but may have some blueprints listed - more on that later.
