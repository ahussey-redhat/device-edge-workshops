## Objective

In this exercise, we are going to review what Image Builder is, and what the workflow looks like when using it.

This exercise will cover:

* Image Builder's place in building images
* What the build workflow looks like


### Understanding the Workflow to Build Images
![Image Builder Workflow](../images/image-builder-workflow.png)

Image Builder is the technology used to craft images. Image Builder allows us to take the Red Hat content we're familiar with, optionally add in third-party content and configurations, and then build a standard image to deploy out to our edge systems.Technically, it can create images for multiple compute destinations: AWS, Azure, VMware, and more, however we're interested in the ability to create edge-focused images.

In the next exercise, we'll be building an edge image using Image Builder.
